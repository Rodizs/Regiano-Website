The concept of a fictional restaurant website came up as an exercise to improve my coding skills using keyframe class and exploring ScrollReveal() documentation https://scrollrevealjs.org/guide/hello-world.html.

The website is 100% responsive, your experience browsing this website will be the same on any platform including animations, content and images.
